                        <p>The Imperium of Man, also called simply the Imperium, is a galaxy-spanning, interstellar
                            Human
                            empire, the ultimate authority for the vast majority of the Human species in the Milky Way
                            galaxy in
                            the 41st Millennium A.D. It is ruled by the living god who is known as the Emperor of
                            Mankind.
                        </p>
                        <p>The founder and ruler of the Imperium is the god-like Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful
                            Human
                            psyker ever born. The Emperor founded the Imperium over 10,000 Terran years ago in the late
                            30th
                            Millennium during the Unification Wars on Old Earth following the apocalyptic period in
                            Human
                            history known as the Age of Strife.</p>
                        <p>The Imperium of Man is a war-torn stellar empire, teetering on the brink of collapse. For
                            10,000
                            Terran years it has been ruled by the deathless Emperor, a being of almost limitless psychic
                            power, to whom thousands of souls are sacrificed daily to provide Him the psychic strength
                            to
                            maintain the Imperium's lines of communication and transport.</p>

                                <p>The Emperor of Mankind, often referred to by His faithful as the "God-Emperor," the
                                    "Master of
                                    Mankind," or simply "the Emperor," and who sometimes referred to Himself as
                                    "Revelation," known
                                    to the forces of Chaos as the False Emperor or the Corpse Emperor, is the immortal
                                    Perpetual and
                                    psyker who serves as the reigning monarch of the Imperium of Man, and is described
                                    by
                                    the
                                    Imperial Ecclesiarchy and the Imperial Cult as the father, guardian and god of
                                    Humanity.
                                </p>
                                <p>He has sat immobile, His body slowly crumbling, within the Golden Throne of Terra for
                                    over 10,000
                                    standard years. Although once a living man, His shattered, decaying body can no

                                    life, and it is kept intact only by the cybernetic mechanisms of the Golden Throne
                                    and a
                                    potent
                                    mind itself sustained by the daily sacrifice of thousands of lives.</p>
                                <p>The Emperor chose to sacrifice His immortal life at the end of the Horus Heresy in
                                    the
                                    service
                                    and protection of Mankind. To Humanity's countless trillions across the
                                    galaxy-spanning
                                    Imperium, He is nothing less than God. Through His Imperium, Humanity is united and
                                    remains one
                                    of the most powerful intelligent species in the Milky Way galaxy as well as its most
                                    dominant in
                                    terms of both population and territory held.</p>
                                <p>Though He is no longer responsive to external stimuli, the Emperor still lies at the
                                    very
                                    heart of the Imperium's continued existence. Although He cannot be directly involved
                                    in
                                    the day-to-day running of Humanity's galactic government, His existence on the
                                    Golden
                                    Throne is vital to sustaining the Imperium, since His powerful mind's presence in
                                    the
                                    Immaterium maintains and directs the Astronomican, the psychic beacon that makes
                                    possible faster-than-light Warp travel and is vital to Imperial shipping,
                                    transportation, commerce and communication.</p>
                                <p>He is said to still guide His race through the psychically-reactive divination tool
                                    known
                                    as the Emperor's Tarot, which select psykers can consult to gain a glimpse of the
                                    future
                                    and the Emperor's will. He is also said to constantly battle the Chaos Gods in the
                                    Warp
                                    and prevent their further intrusion upon the material universe.</p>
                                <p>His mind must remain vigilant at all times throughout the entire Imperium to
                                    safeguard
                                    the Human race and to offer His protection to the faithful. Above all else, it is
                                    Mankind's collective belief in the Emperor's divinity that serves as its greatest
                                    protection from Chaos and the other hideous dangers that plague the galaxy. As the
                                    Imperial Creed has taught for over 10,000 standard years, the Emperor protects...

                                the collective thoughts, fears, and desires of all sentient beings. They are not true

                                amplify the weaknesses of mortal souls. Each embodies an aspect of mortal excess taken

                                gods endure—feeding, growing, and striving to unmake the order of the material universe.

                            <p>The Space Marines or Adeptus Astartes are foremost amongst the defenders of Humanity, the
                                greatest of the Emperor of Mankind's warriors. They are barely Human at all, but
                                superhuman;
                                having been made superior in all respects to a normal man by a harsh regime of genetic
                                modification, psycho-conditioning and rigorous training.</p>
                            <p>Space Marines are untouched by plague or any natural disease and can suffer wounds that
                                would
                                kill a lesser being several times over, and live to fight again. Clad in ancient power
                                armour and wielding the most potent weapons known to man, the Space Marines are
                                terrifying
                                foes and their devotion to the Emperor and the Imperium of Man is unyielding. They are
                                the
                                God-Emperor's Angels of Death, and they know no fear.</p>
                            <p>The Astartes are physically stronger, far more resilient and often mentally far removed
                                from
                                the lot of most normal, unaugmented Human beings. In the presence of the Astartes, most
                                Imperial citizens feel a combination of awe and fear, and many cultures on the more
                                primitive worlds of the galaxy simply worship them outright as demigods or angels of the
                                God-Emperor made flesh.

                            </p>
                            <p>They were intended not to lead Humanity, but to defend it, sometimes even from itself. At
                                the
                                heart of that mission lies the limitless compassion the Emperor extended to every man
                                and
                                woman in the galaxy when He willingly chose to condemn Himself to more than 10,000
                                standard
                                years of imprisonment within a dying prison of flesh for their sake. Some Astartes sneer
                                at
                                compassion, seeing it as one more Human weakness that has been purged from their
                                superior
                                transhuman bodies and minds. But the wisest of the Space Marines know that in the end,
                                compassion is their only salvation.</p>
